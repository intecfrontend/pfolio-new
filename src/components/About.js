      My primary objective is to pursue Kaizen - the principle of continuous improvement - in order to enhance my coding performance. Currently, I am an instructor for web development at Intec Brussels, where I teach my students the fundamentals of coding, from HTML to advanced JavaScript concepts. I am passionate about web development, and I am delighted to see that most of my students find success in the field.

      With a background in graphic design since 1989, I went back to school to learn how to code. Since July 2019, I have been teaching React, which is my favorite framework, at Intec Brussels. As an instructor, one of my greatest strengths is my ability to simplify complex code into more understandable concepts for my students. My students appreciate my multilingualism and my willingness to learn new things that will benefit their learning experience. I am proud to say that I have become a well-regarded job-generator for my students.

      Finally, I take pride in my ability to communicate fluently in multiple languages.
